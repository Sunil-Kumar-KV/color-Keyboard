# Contributing to Keyboard CSS

üôè I would ‚ù§Ô∏è for you to contribute to Keyboard CSS and help make it even better than it is today!

## Developing

Start by cloning the project and installing all dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shhdharmen/keyboard-css.git
cd keyboard-css
npm i
```

Run the playground app:

```bash
npm start
```
## Building

Building and publishing is done through semantic-release and github actions.

As the [@semantic-release/npm](https://github.com/semantic-release/npm) plugin uses the npm CLI to update the package.json version and publish the package, all npm hook scripts will be executed.

We are using the `postversion` hook so it will be executed during the prepare step of [@semantic-release/npm](https://github.com/semantic-release/npm), which allow for example to update files before committing them with the [@semantic-release/git](https://github.com/semantic-release/git) plugin.
